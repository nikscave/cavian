# Cavian
(Eurorack) DIY Gate/Trigger sequencer using Teensy 4.1 and Novation Launchpad Mini

Overview of all features now on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b2nG33aL-s)

Steps:

1. Install [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
2. Solder headers to the USB Host section of the Teensy (+5v, D-, D+, GND)
5. Connect Novation Launchpad mini (tested on Mk1, Mk2 should be ok) to the USB Host headers. 
3. Load Cavian HEX (1.2.2 is latest version as at 8th May 2023) file using the [Teensy Loader](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)
4. Outputs 4 to 11 are used for output triggers/gates. Teensy outputs around 3.5v, plenty for most modules. 
5. Add Temp/Swing(Random probability) encoders as per schematic.
6. Add reset/clock in/outs as per schematic (when you decide to add them)
7. If you add a eurorack 12v to 5v regulator, please share any details and I'll include in here :-) I run mine on USB only.
8. The svg template is how I remember which buttons do which. Post it notes or a sharpie on the LED's will work also :-)

**BETA_B** - bunch of features in progress (18th June 2023)

__Probablity__ - In vertical mode, pressing the button to the **right of FILL** (directly above TRIG2) Enters Prob mode.
Yellow denotes which group/preset/channel to assign. Unselecting will assign chosen step to ALL group/presets/channels depending on what you uncheck.
Once you have chosen a step to assign probability to, adjusting the **SWING** encoder commits % prob to that step.

**Reset In** - had forgotten to implement this! Sending a 12v or less trigger into Reset In jack will mimic pressing the reset button.
Amended the logic to reset to first PRESET in loop. active group will persist. The input protection is a la Hagiwo, and I've not fried any of my arduinos yet ;-)

**Save Banks** - when turning cavian off in vertical mode, right hand side buttons denote active bank 1 through 8. Now there are 63 save points in each bank! Plenty! Top left 3 buttons are Load/Save/Delete. there is no undo, so press carefully.

**Bug fixes** - first step no longer missing on group looping and resetting.

**Feedback / suggestions appreciated**
